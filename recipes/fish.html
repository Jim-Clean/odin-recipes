        <h2>One-pan herby green rice & fish with harissa-rippled 
            yoghurt & lemon</h2>
        <p>
            Turn regular rice into something extraordinary and exciting with 
            this joyful one-pan dish. Now, I want you to think of this 
            recipe as more of a principle – it’s fairly flexible and can be 
            taken in lots of different directions. Jazz it up with your 
            favourite seafood, mix up the greens you choose or throw in some 
            additional vegetables – whatever you fancy. For me, this makes 
            the perfect midweek meal – fresh, tasty, ready in 15-minutes 
            flat, and with minimal washing up. Yes please!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.1 litres (2 pints) organic stock (chicken, fish or
                vegetable, as appropriate)
            </li>
            <li>8 spring onions</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 bunch of fresh corriander (30g)</li>
            <li>100g baby spinach</li>
            <li>1 mug of basmati rice (300g)</li>
            <li>4 x 150g white fish fillets, such as cod, haddock, pollock, 
                megrim, skin off, pin-boned , from sustainable sources</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons natural yoghurt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons harissa</li>
            <li>optional: 1/2 a fresh red chilli</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim 8 spring onions (put one aside for later), peel 2 cloves 
                of garlic and pick the leaves from 1 bunch of fresh coriander 
                (30g), reserving a few to garnish, then place in a blender.</li>
            <li>Add 100g of baby spinach, along with 2 mugs (600ml) of water 
                and blitz until smooth – you may need to work in batches.</li>
            <li>Tip 1 mug of rice (300g) into a large shallow casserole pan, 
                pour over the green sauce, mix well and cook on a high heat 
                uncovered for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Give the rice a good stir, then carefully place 4 x 150g 
                white fish fillets on top. Season to taste with sea salt and 
                black pepper, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then 
                cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and cook gently for 
                a further 5 to 7 minutes, or until the rice is fluffy and 
                fragrant and the fish is pearly white and flaking.</li>
            <li>Dollop 4 tablespoons of natural yoghurt into a bowl, ripple 
                through 2 teaspoons of harissa and drizzle lightly with 
                olive oil.</li>
            <li>Finely slice the remaining spring onion and ½ a fresh red 
                chilli (if using), then scatter over the top along with the 
                reserved coriander leaves. Cut 1 lemon into wedges for 
                squeezing over, then serve along with the harissa yoghurt. 
                Delicious with a crunchy green salad.
