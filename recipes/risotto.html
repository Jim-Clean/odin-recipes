        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.1 litres (2 pints) organic stock (chicken, fish or
                vegetable, as appropriate)
            </li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>4 or 5 sticks of celery</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>70g of butter, plus 1 extra knob for frying</li>
            <li>400g of risotto rice</li>
            <li>2 wineglasses of dry white vermouth (dry Martini 
                or Noilly Prat) or dry white wine
            </li>
            <li>115g Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the stock. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. 
                Trim and finely chop the celery.</li>
            <li>Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the knob of butter into a 
                separate pan, add the onion, garlic and celery, and cook very
                 slowly for about 15 minutes without colouring. This is 
                 called a soffrito. When the vegetables have softened, 
                 add the rice and turn up the heat.</li>
            <li>The rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it. 
                After a minute it will look slightly translucent. Add the 
                vermouth or wine and keep stirring – it will smell fantastic. 
                Any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice 
                with a tasty essence.</li>
            <li>Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your 
                first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of sea salt. Turn 
                the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn't cook too quickly 
                on the outside. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and 
                massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each 
                ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take 
                around 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste the rice to check if it’s cooked. If not, carry on 
                adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. 
                Don’t forget to check the seasoning carefully. If you run out 
                of stock before the rice is cooked, add some boiling water.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and add the 70g butter and grate in the 
                Parmesan. Stir well. Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit 
                for 2 minutes. This is the most important part of making the 
                perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes amazingly creamy 
                and oozy like it should be. Eat it as soon as possible, while 
                it retains its beautiful texture.
