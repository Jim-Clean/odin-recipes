TOP recipe HTML project

Project purpose to allow practice of all the techniques learned about HTML and use good git practices.

Used all the techniques from the previous lessons to input the correct images, ingredient lists and text styles. Good experience using git properly for the first time, hopefully my commit messages are half decent.

Looking forward to learning css so I can make the website look nice.
